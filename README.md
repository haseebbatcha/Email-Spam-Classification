Email Spam Classification
The Email Spam Classification project leverages machine learning techniques to accurately identify and filter spam emails, enhancing email security and user productivity. This project aims to provide an effective solution for distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails, using various text processing and classification algorithms.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Efficiently cleans and preprocesses email text data to prepare it for model training. This includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to convert email text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
Classification Algorithms: Implements a range of machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to classify emails as spam or not spam.
Model Evaluation: Provides detailed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the performance of the classification models.
Interactive Interface: With Streamlit, offers an easy-to-use web interface where users can input email text and get real-time classification results.
